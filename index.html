	<p style="text-align:left;">Currently I earn my bread and butter by working as a Machine Learning Engineer and its the greatest
	joy of my life that I get paid for the work I love doing! Except the data cleaningðŸ˜° (its challenging).</p>
	
	<p style="text-align:left;">My passion resides in what, why & how of deep learning and I contribute to 
	deep learning with my Github repo on Deep Learning with Pytorch, which exclusively contains learning deep 
	learning using pytorch and building projects and deploy the same.</p> 
	
	<p>When I don't read fiction/non-fiction ðŸ“–, I read deep learning research paper ðŸ“ƒ and shares my understanding
	through annotation/implementation of the same in Github repo. I'm a active writer in Medium.</p>
	
	<p>I am an avid reader, I read with the purpose to acquire knowledge of anything interesting. I like writing for 
	the sole purpose to enhance my understanding what I read. Dream is to travel all the mysterious sighting in the world!
	Feel free to ping me anytime to discuss anything of interest.</p>
