**Deep Learning is a vast field of research and understanding the nitty-gritty details of
deep learning model helps an individual to become a better researcher and a Deep Learning Practitioner.
With 30000+ Deep Learning paper getting published every year it becomes quite stressful to keep track of
all the research.**

**Thus, the objective to annotate paper is to understand the important details of the paper like the Objective function,
optimization technique and related topics.**

## **Annotated Papers**

#### **Unsupervised Learning**

[**Invariant Information Clustering for Unsupervised Image Classification and Segmentation**](https://github.com/Mayurji/Deep-Learning-Papers/tree/master/Invariant%20Information%20Clustering) 

#### **Supervised Learning**

[**Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition**](https://github.com/Mayurji/Deep-Learning-Papers/tree/master/Resnet) 

[**Understanding the Role of Individual Units in a Deep Neural Networks**](https://github.com/Mayurji/Deep-Learning-Papers/tree/master/Investigate DNN/)

### Note

Some of the paper has been implemented based on compute power available.
