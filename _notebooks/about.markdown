![Mayur]({{site.url}}/assets/images/profile/mayur.jpg) 



I work as a Data Scientist in Verizon with experience in multiple domains. I have worked and built systems reflecting 
better user experience with NLP systems and also enabled systems to provide solid search experience for SEO.

My passion resides in what, why & how of deep learning and I contribute to deep learning with my Github repo on Deep Learning with Pytorch, which exclusively contains learning deep learning using pytorch and building projects and deploy the same. In my free time, I read deep learning research paper and shares my understanding through annotation/implementation of the same in Github repo.

I write about Data Science in Medium and have immense interest & passion for Research in AI.
