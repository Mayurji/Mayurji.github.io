**NEURAL NETWORK**

Neural Network models are similar to machine learning models in context of learning a function. 
For instance, In Linear regression, the model learns the parameter $$w$$ in equation $$y=wx+c$$.
In Neural Networks, the models learns parameters w for complex unstructured datasets such images,
audio, text etc.

The idea behind neural network is inspired from brain, researchers believed that neurons in brain are fired 
when it cross a threshold of sensitivity, the brain is basically a logical inference machine because neurons 
are binary. Neurons compute a weighted sum of inputs and compare that sum to its threshold. It turns on if 
it’s above the threshold and turns off if it’s below, which is a simplified view of how neural networks work.

The key difference between ml model vs a dl model is the feature extraction technique. We perform feature
engineering in machine learning model manually and use our creativity to build better features for the model
to learn but a deep learning model uses multiple layers of neurons(parameters) to learns extensive features from
the data during training.

The complexity of a neural network increases with complexity in the data and the task in hand. Neural
network are preferred less over machine learning model because of the explainability and interpretability
provided by simple ml algorithms. While using neural networks, there is a trade-off between explainability 
and performance in terms of accuracy. Currently, there is lot of active research being done to unravel the
black box called neural nets.
