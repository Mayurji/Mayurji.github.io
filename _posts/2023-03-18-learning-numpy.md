# Building a One-stop-shop for Numpy

If you are venturing into data science or machine learning, you will most likely encounter the Python library NumPy. NumPy is an open-source library that is widely used in scientific computing and data analysis. It provides robust support for multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, and a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on them. Here are some of the most commonly used functions that can help you get started with NumPy.

## Creating arrays

Arrays are at the core of NumPy. Creating arrays in NumPy is straightforward, and there are several ways to do it. The most common way of creating arrays is by using the `array()` function, which takes in a list or tuple and returns an array. For example, to create a 1-dimensional array with three elements, you can use the following code:

```
import numpy as np

my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3])
```

If you want to create a two-dimensional array with three rows and two columns, you can use a nested list:

```
my_2d_array = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
```

## Mathematical operations

NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on arrays. These functions are optimized for numerical operations and are much faster than their Python counterparts. Some of the most commonly used mathematical functions include:

- `np.add()`: Adds two arrays element-wise
- `np.subtract()`: Subtracts two arrays element-wise
- `np.multiply()`: Multiplies two arrays element-wise
- `np.divide()`: Divides two arrays element-wise

Here is an example of how to use the `add()` function to add two arrays:

```
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
c = np.add(a, b)

print(c) # output: [5, 7, 9]
```

## Array manipulation

NumPy provides several functions for manipulating arrays. Here are some commonly used functions:

- `np.reshape()`: Reshapes an array into a new shape
- `np.concatenate()`: Joins two or more arrays
- `np.transpose()`: Transposes an array

Here is an example of how to use the `reshape()` function to reshape an array:

```
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
b = np.reshape(a, (2, 3))
print(b) 

# output: 
[[1, 2, 3], 
 [4, 5, 6]]
```

Here is an example of how to use the `concatenate()` function to join two arrays:

```
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
c = np.concatenate((a, b))

print(c) 
# output: 
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

Here is an example of how to use the `transpose()` function to transpose an array:

```
a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
b = np.transpose(a)
print(b)

# output: 
[[1, 3, 5], 
 [2, 4, 6]]
```

## Conclusion

These are just a few of the many functions that NumPy provides. With these functions, you can perform a wide range of operations on arrays and matrices. NumPy is a powerful library that can help you streamline your data analysis and machine learning workflows.
