I would highly encourage you to read the part I of git before moving ahead.

### Branching

* Branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. 
* We can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history. 
* New commits are recorded in the history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project.
* The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches. 
* It doesnâ€™t let you switch between branches or put a forked history back together again.
* For this reason, git branch is tightly integrated with the **git checkout and git merge commands.**

We can find the current branch using *git status* command and by default *main* is the default branch.

Now consider we are building a mobile app and we are adding a new feature to our application. It is appropriate to create a separate branch to build the new feature, where we can keep track of all the updates related to this new feature alone and merge with main branch after completion.

**How to create branch?**

*cmd:* `git branch feature_menu_bar`

*cmd:* `git status`

We'll check current branch using status command and then move to the newly created branch.

**How to move to new branch?**

*cmd:* `git checkout feature_menu_bar`** 

`checkout` command helps in switching to the new branch, `checkout` keeps the branch on latest commit for that branch, like head commit for the branch.

*cmd:* `git status`

**How to move to main branch again**

*cmd:* `git checkout main`

Let's explore the new branch and commit few stuff.

*cmd:* `git checkout feature_menu_bar`

*cmd:* `nano file1`

*write some lines*

*save the file*

*cmd:* `git commit -a -m "Getting stated with Menu Bar"`

*cmd:* `git log`

**Latest commit details is present in the new branch logs**

We can switch to master to see what happened to its history using git log.

*cmd:* `git checkout master`

*cmd:* `git log`

The last commit will not be "Getting started with Menu Bar". Since it was made in feature_menu_bar branch.

**How to create and switch to a branch using one command**

*cmd:* `git checkout -b "feature_Sidebar"`

*cmd:* `git log`

Note: the latest commit in this branch will be same as master branch because we created this branch while staying in master branch. It is a version started from master branch.

If we move to feature_menu_bar and then create feature_Sidebar branch, then my latest commit would be taken from "feature_menu_bar" since i have started a version from it.

**How to find all the branches in the repo**

*cmd:* `git branch`

It shows all the branches and current branch with * symbol.

**How to delete a branch**

*cmd:* `git branch -D feature_Sidebar`

### Merging

As we can infer from the term, merging helps in merging multiple branches. A major challenge faced by programmers during merge is when a file in branch1 and same file in branch2 undergoes a change, then it results in conflict.

*cmd:* `git checkout main`

*cmd:* `git status`

Merge the feature_menu_bar to main, In feature_menu_bar, we have committed a file change in file1.

*cmd:* `git merge feature_menu_bar`

*cmd:* `git log`

Now, the branch histroy will be merged i.e. the latest commit in master would be "Getting started with Menu Bar".

**How to resolve conflict while merging?**

* First, we create a ReadMe file in main branch and save it. 
* Commit the update made in ReadMe
* Next, we switch to feature_menu_bar branch.
* Update the content of ReadME and save it.
* Commit the update made in ReadMe
* Switch to main branch
* Merge the feature_menu_bar branch with main.

*cmd:* `nano ReadME`

*make change in file ReadME*

*save the file*

*cmd:* `git commit -a -m "Changes made in README"`

*cmd:* `git checkout feature_menu_bar`

*cmd:* `nano ReadME`

*make change in file README*

*save the file*

*cmd:* `git commit -a -m "Changes made in ReadME"`

*cmd:* `git checkout main`

*cmd:* `git merge feature_menu_bar`

If git is able to find the conflict, it tries to resolve it on its own using "Auto-Merging". If the same line in the same file is changed in both the branches the **git cannot rectify the conflict**.

**Changing same file & same line in both the branches**

*cmd:* `git branch`

*cmd:* `nano file1`

*edit line 1*

*save the file*

*cmd:* `git commit -a -m "Changed line 1"`

*cmd:* `git checkout feature_menu_bar`

*cmd:* `nano file1`

*edit line 1*

*save the file*

*cmd:* `git commit -a -m "Changed Line 1"`

*cmd:* `git checkout main`

*cmd:* `git merge feature_menu_bar`

Now, Auto-Merging fails. Conflicted files shows us the both the changes we have made and asks us to how to handle it. we can edit it manually and then add and commit again. We can go back to the files and keep the changes requried and updated the file.

*cmd:* `nano file1`

*edit line 1*

*save the file*

*cmd:* `git add file1`

*cmd:* `git commit -a -m "Conflict removed"`

Thus, we have learnt how to create branches, merge two branches and remove the conflict while merging. Next we'll see how to work with remote repository.

### Working on Remote Repository

Let's clone the remote repository to local system. Below command creates a folder with repo name with all the files from remote repository.

*cmd:* `git clone url_of_the_repo_new_clone` 

*cmd:* `git remote` 

It shows all the remotes to this repository,"origin". It creates a copy/originated from the remote repo. 

Note: if you clone a repo from local repo (git clone /git_basics), then it won't be remote. We need to add the cloned repo to remote first.

git_basics is the local repository.

*cmd:* `git clone /git_basics git_basic_cloned` // origin (name of the remote)

*cmd:* `git remote`

*cmd:* `cd git_basics`

*cmd:* `git remote`

*cmd:* `git remote add our_clone /git_basic_cloned`

*cmd:* `git remote`

It will help in making the both the repo to talk to each other.

**Push and pull from remote**

*cmd:* `cd git_basic_cloned`

*cmd:* `git checkout -b notification_bar`

*cmd:* `nano file1`

*edit the file*

*save the file*

*cmd:* `git commit -a -m "change made in file1"`

*cmd:* `git push` // Won't do anything specific

*cmd:* `git push notification_bar` // edit to mention explictly to which remote

*cmd:* `git push origin notification_bar`

Switch to git_basics and see if the commits made by above branch is reflecting or not

*cmd:* `cd git_basics`

*cmd:* `git branch`

The notification_bar branch should be available in **`git_basics`** repo as well. Changes made in remote branch is available in local repo.
