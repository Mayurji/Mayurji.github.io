### Branching

* A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. 
* You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history. 
* New commits are recorded in the history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project.
* The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches. 
* It doesnâ€™t let you switch between branches or put a forked history back together again.
* For this reason, git branch is tightly integrated with the **git checkout and git merge commands.**

**Status will let us know which branch we are in. Master is the default branch in git repo.** 

### Consider adding to new feature your project

*cmd:* **`git branch feature_menu_bar`**

*cmd:* **`git status`**

Still in master branch
### Move to new branch

*cmd:* **`git checkout feature_menu_bar`** // **`checkout`** command helps in switching to the new branch, **`checkout`** keeps the branch on latest commit for that branch. It like head commit for the branch.

*cmd:* **`git status`**

### Move to master again

*cmd:* **`git checkout master`**

***************************************************************************************************************************************************************

*cmd:* **`git checkout feature_menu_bar`**

*cmd:* **`nano file1`**

*write some lines*

*save the file*

*cmd:* **`git commit -a -m "Getting stated with Menu Bar"`**

*cmd:* **`git log`**

### Latest commit details is present in new branch

**Switch to master to see what happened using git log**

*cmd:* **`git checkout master`**

*cmd:* **`git log`**

**The last commit will not be "Getting started with Menu Bar". Since it was made in feature_menu_bar branch.**

***************************************************************************************************************************************************************

### Creating and Switching to Branch in one command

*cmd:* **`git checkout -b "feature_Sidebar"`**

*cmd:* **`git log`**

**Note: the latest commit in this branch will be same as master branch because we created this branch while staying in master branch. Its a version started from master branch.**

**If i move to feature_menu_bar and then create feature_Sidebar branch, then my latest commit would be taken from "feature_menu_bar"** 
**since i have started a version from it.**

***************************************************************************************************************************************************************

### Finding all branches

*cmd:* **`git branch`**

**Shows all the branches and current branch with * symbol.**

### Delete branch

*cmd:* **`git branch -D feature_Sidebar`**

***************************************************************************************************************************************************************

### Important Concepts Of Git Is Merging 

**If file1 in branch1 and same file in branch2 has undergone a changes then conflict can happen.**

*cmd:* **`git checkout master`**

*cmd:* **`git status`**

**Merge the feature_menu_bar to master, In feature_menu_bar, where we have committed a file change in file1.**

*cmd:* **`git merge feature_menu_bar`**

*cmd:* **`git log`**

**Now, the branch histroy will be merged i.e. the latest commit in master would be "Getting started with Menu Bar".**

***************************************************************************************************************************************************************

### Creating Conflict And Resolving It

*cmd:* **`nano ReadME`**

*make change in file ReadME*

*save the file*

*cmd:* **`git commit -a -m "Changes made in README"`**

*cmd:* **`git checkout feature_menu_bar`**

*cmd:* **`nano ReadME`**

*make change in file README*

*save the file*

*cmd:* **`git commit -a -m "Changes made in ReadME"`**

*cmd:* **`git checkout master`**

*cmd:* **`git merge feature_menu_bar`**

**If git is able to find the conflict, it tries to resolve it on its own. "Auto-Merging". If the same line in same file is changed in both the branches the git cannot rectify the conflict.**

***************************************************************************************************************************************************************

### Change same file and the same line in two Branches

*cmd:* **`git branch`**

*cmd:* **`nano file1`**

*edit line 1*

*save the file*

*cmd:* **`git commit -a -m "Changed line 1"`**

*cmd:* **`git checkout feature_menu_bar`**

*cmd:* **`nano file1`**

*edit line 1*

*save the file*

*cmd:* **`git commit -a -m "Changed Line 1"`**

*cmd:* **`git checkout master`**

*cmd:* **`git merge feature_menu_bar`**

**Now the Auto-Merging fails.**

**Note: the conflicted files shows us the both the changes we have made and asks us to how to handle it. we can edit it manually and then**
**add and commit again.**

*cmd:* **`nano file1`**

*edit line 1*

*save the file*

*cmd:* **`git add file1`**

*cmd:* **`git commit -a -m "Conflict removed"`**

***************************************************************************************************************************************************************

### Working on Remote Repository

*cmd:* **`git clone url_of_the_repo new_clone`** // creates a folder new_clone with all the files from remote repository.

*cmd:* **`git remote`** // it shows all the remotes to this repository,"origin". It creates a copy/originated from the remote repo. 

**Note: if you clone a repo from local repo (git clone /git_basics), then it won't be remote. We need to add the cloned repo to remote first.**

*cmd:* **`git clone /git_basics git_basic_cloned`** // origin (name of the remote)

*cmd:* **`git remote`**

*cmd:* **`cd git_basics`**

*cmd:* **`git remote`**

*cmd:* **`git remote add our_clone /git_basic_cloned`**

*cmd:* **`git remote`**

**It will help in making the both the repo to talk to each other.**

***************************************************************************************************************************************************************

### Push and Pull From Remote

*cmd:* **`cd git_basic_cloned`**

*cmd:* **`git checkout -b notification_bar`**

*cmd:* **`nano file1`**

*edit the file*

*save the file*

*cmd:* **`git commit -a -m "change made in file1"`**

*cmd:* **`git push`** // Won't do anything specific

*cmd:* **`git push notification_bar`** // edit to mention explictly to which remote

*cmd:* **`git push origin notification_bar`**

**Switch to git_basics and see if the commits made by above branch is reflecting or not**

*cmd:* **`cd git_basics`**

*cmd:* **`git branch`**

The notification_bar branch should be available in **`git_basics`** repo as well.
