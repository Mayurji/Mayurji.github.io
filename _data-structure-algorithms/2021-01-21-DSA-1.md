I am a Machine Learning Engineer, who made his way through programming without much focus on **Data Structure and Algorithms**. Now, while applying to top tech companies, I'm always asked about my grasp in DSA. To enhance my skill set in DSA, I'll be posting blogs on all the basics and the most frequently asked topics in DSA.

### What is Data Structure and Algorithms?

In computer program, we perform a task or action based on some input. Now, how this task is done depends on various factors like how the data is stored, how to retrieve the data, how to compute or manipulate data to achieve the required task, which brings us to the topic of Data Structure and Algorithms.

**Data structure** is a way to structure the data for storage and retrieval. **Algorithms** are used to manipulate these stored data to perform a task.

### Why DSA?

The objective of a computer program is to solve a problem and there are multiple ways to solve a problem, some are easy to write but are inefficient way, while others are hard to write but efficient way. When I say efficient, I mean the program takes less **time** and less **space** to achieve the solution. So to answer why DSA? DSA helps in writing efficient code which takes less **time** and less **space**. Space refers to memory.

We'll understand why algorithms are important using a simple example of *finding a sum of N number*?

**Naive approach**

```python
%%time
N = 1000
sum = 0
for i in range(1, N+1):
    sum += i
print(sum)

'''
500500
CPU times: user 269 µs, sys: 54 µs, total: 323 µs
Wall time: 326 µs
'''
```
The time complexity of above function O(n), since each element is iterated over from 1 till N+1.

**Algorithmic approach**

```python
#Using Math Formula to find sum of N number 

%%time
val = (N * (N + 1))/2
print(val)

'''
500500.0
CPU times: user 74 µs, sys: 17 µs, total: 91 µs
Wall time: 79.6 µs
'''
```
The time complexity for the algorithmic approach is O(1), just one operation at constant time.

Here, the amount of time taken by algorithmic approach is 1/4th of the naive approach to add N numbers. Though there is a existing formula for Sum of N number, but that formula came into existence only after the author found its algorithmic approach.

> The story of **Carl Friedrich Gauss**—who, as an elementary student in the late 1700s, amazed his teacher with how quickly he found the **sum** of the **integers** from 1 to 100 to be 5,050.

### Asymptotic Analysis and Notations

When we write a program, the program takes in different range of inputs and based on these inputs, the performance changes. These changes in performance based on the change in input is referred as **Asymptotic Analysis**. 

**Asymptotic Notations** are used to describe the run time of a program. A program can perform at three level i.e. best case, worst case and the average case. 

*For example: In bubble sort, when the input array is already sorted, the time taken by the algorithm is linear i.e. the best case. But, when the input array is in reverse condition, the algorithm  takes the maximum time (quadratic) to sort the elements i.e. the worst case. When the input array is neither sorted nor in reverse order, then it takes average time. These duration are denoted using **asymptotic notations**.*

There are mainly three asymptotic notations:

- Big-O notation
- Omega notation
- Theta notation

I will not deep dive into notation, because it didn't make much sense to me, about which notation is used for representing the complexity of a program. People widely use Big O notation to represent the complexity.

*Big Oh* - the rate of growth of an algorithm is less than or equal to a specific value, called Worst Case.

*Big Omega* - the rate of growth is greater than or equal to a specified value, called Best Case.

*Big Theta* - the rate of growth is equal to a specified value, called Average Case.

### Approaches

Three key approaches to solve a computing problem are

* Divide and Conquer Algorithms
* Greedy Algorithms
* Dynamic Programming

### Divide and Conquer strategy

As the name suggest, we can breakdown a large problem into smaller problems and combine the results of all smaller problem to get the solution of a large problem. To apply this strategy, we use recursion technique.

*Recursion: It is the process of defining something in terms of itself. We know that a function can call other functions. It is even possible for the function to call itself. These types of construct are termed as recursive functions.*

**Steps in Divide and Conquer:**

* Check if the larger problem can be broken down into smaller problems?
* If yes, then divide the problem into sub-problems using recursion.
* Solve the smaller sub-problems recursively. If the sub-problem is small enough, then solve it directly.
* Combine the solutions of the sub-problems that are part of the recursive process to solve the actual problem.

### Greedy Algorithms

The greedy algorithm is an approach for solving problem where we have multiple options to select from, and we select the one with immediate best result, without worrying about future results. In other words, the locally best choices aim at producing globally best results. Greedy algorithms follow top-down approach.

**Steps in Greedy Algorithm**

1. To begin with, the solution set (containing answers) is empty.
2. At each step, an item is added into the solution set.
3. If the solution set is feasible, the current item is kept.
4. Else, the item is rejected and never considered again.

Example:

**Problem:** You have to make a change of an amount using the smallest possible number of coins.
Amount: $28

Available coins:
  $5 coin
  $2 coin
  $1 coin

**Solution:**

1. Create an empty solution-set = { }.
2. coins = {5, 2, 1}
3. sum = 0
4. While sum ≠ 28, do the following.
5. Select a coin C from coins such that sum + C < 28.
6. If C + sum > 28, return no solution.
7. Else, sum = sum + C.
8. Add C to solution-set.

Up to the first 5 iterations, the solution set contains 5 $5 coins. After that, we get 1 $2 coin and finally, 1 $1 coin.

### Dynamic Programming (DP)

Dynamic Programming is a technique in computer programming that helps to efficiently solve a class of problems that have overlapping sub-problems and optimal substructure property. Such problems involve repeatedly calculating the value of the same sub-problems to find the optimum solution. 

For instance, to generate Fibonacci sequence, If the sequence is F(1) F(2) F(3)........F(50), it follows the rule F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).

Notice how there are overlapping sub-problems, we need to calculate F(48) to calculate both F(50) and F(49). This is exactly the kind of algorithm where Dynamic Programming shines.

**How it works**

While solving the sub-problems, we store the results of the subproblem in an array and use it whenever it is required in the later stage, instead of calculating it again. This technique of storing the results of sub-problem is called as **memoization**. Dynamic programming using memoization is known as top-down approach.

Generating Fibonacci Sequence

```
var m = map(0 → 0, 1 → 1)
function fib(n)
    if key n is not in map m 
        m[n] = fib(n − 1) + fib(n − 2)
    return m[n]
```

We can also solve the problem from bottom-up manner by reversing the flow by following the base case and moving up to the solution.

```
function fib(n)
    if n = 0
        return 0
    else
        var prevFib = 0, currFib = 1
        repeat n − 1 times
            var newFib = prevFib + currFib
            prevFib = currFib
            currFib  = newFib
    return currentFib
```

In the next post, we'll see data structures like Stack, Queue and Heap and its implementation.
