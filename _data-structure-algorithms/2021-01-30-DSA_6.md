## Tree Data Structure

In this blog post, we'll learn about **tree** data structure, all the jargon surrounding it and different variants of tree data structure.

**Tree is a non-linear hierarchical data structure consisting of vertices (nodes) and edges.** Trees lies on other spectrum of data structure when compared with data structures like [stack, queue, linked list etc](https://mayurji.github.io/data-structure-algorithms/2021-01-23-DSA_2). In stack, queue and Linked list the data structure is linear and the elements are added in sequence. 

Any operation in linear data structure has increasing time complexity as the size of the data increases, which makes it less suitable for the real world problems. **Increasing time complexity is avoided by using non-linear data structure.**

### Jargon

* **Vertex/Node** - It contains the key or value or pointers to child vertex. Bottom most node is called as **leaf node or external node**. It has **no link** going down from it. A node having a child node and is below root is called **internal node.**
* **Edges** - It is a link between two node.
* **Height of a Tree** - It is the height of the root node or the depth of the deepest node.
* **Height of a Node** - It is the number of edges from the node to the last leaf (deepest node) of the tree.
* **Root** - It is the top most node 
* **Depth of a Node**-  It is the number of edges from the root to the node.
* **Degree** - It is the total number of branches of that node.
* **Forest** - It is the collection of disjoint trees.

### Types of Trees

There are various tree data structure but some of the widely known tree data structure are as follows

* Binary Tree
* Binary Search Tree
* AVL Tree
* B-Tree

We'll discuss each of these tree data structure separately in another blog post.

### Tree traversal

To perform any operation on a node, we should traverse through a path in tree to reach that required node. In linear data structure, because of sequential linearity, traversing is simple either from front or rear. In non-linear data structure, we have different ways to reach a node. To find a smallest node in the tree, we should traverse through all the nodes in the tree, but can be reduced with better search techniques.

**In General, a tree is traversed from root and then to left child and then to right child.** It is not mandatory to traverse through tree in any predetermined way, if required, one can traverse from bottom-up or top-down with random intermediate order between internal nodes. However, random traversing will never benefit in performing the task efficiently. Thus, we should follow a set of traversal techniques.

During traversing, a basic structure of tree must be followed by 

* each node must have data.
* each node might have left and right child.

we should consider each such node with child as sub-tree because, these child nodes can further have more sub-nodes.

<p>Figure 4: Tree Traversal - Subtree</p> 
</center>

If our goal is to traverse through whole tree, then we should traverse through left sub-tree first and then root node and then right sub-tree. Depending on the order of our traversal we have three way for traversing.

**Variants of Tree Traversal**

* In-order Traversal
* Pre-order Traversal
* Post-order Traversal

**Inorder Traversal**

1. First, visit all the nodes in the left sub-tree
2. Then the root node
3. Visit all the nodes in the right sub-tree

**Pre-order Traversal**

1. Visit root node
2. Visit all the nodes in the left sub-tree
3. Visit all the nodes in the right sub-tree

**Post-order Traversal**

1. Visit all the nodes in the left subtree
2. Visit all the nodes in the right subtree
3. Visit the root node

### Implementation - Traversal Using Recursion

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, item):
        self.item = item
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        
def inorder(root):

    if root:
        # Traverse left
        inorder(root.left)
        # Traverse root
        print(str(root.item) + "->", end='')
        # Traverse right
        inorder(root.right)
    

def postorder(root):

    if root:
        # Traverse left
        postorder(root.left)
        # Traverse right
        postorder(root.right)
        # Traverse root
        print(str(root.item) + "->", end='')


def preorder(root):

    if root:
        # Traverse root
        print(str(root.item) + "->", end='')
        # Traverse left
        preorder(root.left)
        # Traverse right
        preorder(root.right)
    


root = Node(1)
root.left = Node(2)
root.right = Node(3)
root.left.left = Node(4)
root.left.right = Node(5)

print("Inorder traversal ")

inorder(root)

print("\nPreorder traversal ")
preorder(root)

print("\nPostorder traversal ")
postorder(root)

"""
Inorder traversal 
4->2->5->1->3->
Preorder traversal 
1->2->4->5->3->
Postorder traversal 
4->5->2->3->1->
"""
```

**Remember each function call in recursion is stored in stack and has its execution context, once a function call is done, it is removed from stack.**

* For in-order traversal, First, we pass the complete tree to **inorder** function.
* Check if condition is true or not? since tree is not empty, we move inside **if block**.
* Next, we make recursion call with root's left child (node 2, here), again a recursive call is made with node 2's left child that is node 4. 
* Next, we check the condition with node 4's left child. since no left child is present for node 4. Now the unwinding starts happening in recursive call.
* Now, 4 is printed and then node 4's right child is checked for if condition, there is no right child for node 4. it comes out.
* Next, 2 is printed then node 2's right child is checked for if condition, we have right child here, that is node 5, again recursion starts. 
* similar we move from left to right, until we reach last right node 3.

The **base condition** of recursion is not satisfied, until all the nodes are traversed, **if root:** condition is False, means all nodes are traversed.

### Application

* Binary search tree is used for efficient searching of an element in the tree.
* Heap is also a tree, used for heap sort.
* Popular Databases uses B-Trees and T-Trees
* Syntax tree is used in compilers while executing an program.
