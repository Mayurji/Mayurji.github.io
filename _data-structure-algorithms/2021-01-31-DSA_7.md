In this blog post, we'll discuss and implement **Binary Tree** and its variants in python. **Binary Tree** is a tree where each parent node has **at most two nodes**. There are different types of binary trees based on the number of leaf nodes or internal child nodes.

### Types of Binary Tree

**Full Binary Tree** 
  - Each parent node or child node has either exactly two child node or no child node.

**Perfect Binary Tree**
  - Each parent node or internal node has exactly two child node and the leaf nodes should be at same level.

**Complete Binary Tree**
  - It is similar to full binary tree with few differences
  	* All levels must be completely filled
  	* All leaf nodes must lean towards left
  	* The last leaf node may or may not have a right sibling.

**Degenerate or Pathological Tree** 
  - A tree has single child either on left or right.

**Skewed Binary Tree** 
  - A tree dominated by either the left nodes or right nodes is a skewed tree
	  * Right skewed tree
	  * Left skewed tree
  
**Balanced Binary Tree** 
  - The difference between the left and the right sub-tree for each node is either 0 or 1.

 Lets rewind a bit, we've discussed in binary heap, how the position(index) of a node can be calculated from any node.

**Steps - Finding Index of a Node**

* If a **Node** is at index **i**, then
* its left child index can be calculated by **2*i+ 1**
* its right child index can be calculated by **2*i + 2**
* its parent node can be calculated by **Floor Value of (i/2)** i.e. **3.5 as 3**.

**Binary Tree - Node Object**

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, item):
        self.item = item
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
```

**Implementation - Full Binary Tree**

```python
### Each node has two or no child node 
class Node:
    def __init__(self, item):
        self.item = item
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        
def fullBinaryTree(root):
    # Check if the root is empty or not
    if root is None:
        return True
    
    #Check if root's left and right child is empty or not
    if (root.left is None) and (root.right is None): 
        return True
    
    if (root.left is not None) and (root.right is not None): 
        #check if both the root's right and left child is not empty, then recurse through subtree and repeat.
        return (fullBinaryTree(root) and fullBinaryTree(root.right))

"""

```

**Implementation - Perfect Binary Tree**

```python
### Every parent and internal node should have atmost two child nodes and level should remain same.

    if root is None:

    if (root.left is None and root.right is None): 
        return (d == level + 1)
    
    #check if any of root's child is empty or not, if empty, then return as False
    if (root.left is None or root.right is None): 
        return False
    
    # recurse through the left and right child and increase the level by 1 during every recursion!
    return (perfectBinaryTree(root.left, d, level+1) and perfectBinaryTree(root.right, d, level + 1))

    d=0
    
    #iterate through the all the left of nodes from root of the tree and count the depth!
    while (node is not None): 
        d += 1
        node = node.left
    return d

* Heap sort

* AVL Tree
* Balanced Binary Search Tree

Next, we'll continue with binary search tree.
