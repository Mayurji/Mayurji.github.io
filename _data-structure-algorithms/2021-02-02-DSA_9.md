## AVL Tree

RANDOM IMAGE

If we wonder, how large databases makes efficient search of a record from its table, then AVL tree is here to help us understand, how efficient indexing provides faster search result in large databases. In this blog post, we'll discuss what is AVL tree, how to implement one and where it is used. AVL got its name from the inventor Adelson-Velsky and Landis.

### What is AVL Tree

We have seen what is [Balanced Tree in the previous blog](), where we describe a tree whose difference between left sub-tree and right sub-tree is $$ &le $$1, while in AVL tree, we create a **self-balancing tree where each node maintains a separate information about balance factor,** whose value is **-1, 0, +1**. To maintain the self-balancing property of AVL tree, the balance factor across all nodes should be -1, 0, +1.

IMAGE Balanced vs Imbalanced

**Balance Factor** of a node is the difference between the height of the left sub-tree and right sub-tree, w.r.t that node.

Balance Factor (BF) = (height of Left ST - height of Right ST) or (height of Right ST - height of Left ST)

**Why AVL Trees?**

In previous blog post, we saw binary search tree which works on the sorted list of numbers. For instance, consider a list of elements, if we form a BST, which follows BST property where, node(left) < node(root) < node(right), then we can generate two possible binary search tree based on how the elements in the list are arranged.

IMAGE WHY AVL TREE

The time taken depends on the arrangement of the elements. A way to reduce the height of the BST is to rotate the elements in it. The time taken for skewed BST is similar to linear search. Thus, we use AVL trees to ensure that the height of the tree remain **log n**.

Following are two basic operations that can be performed to re-balance a BST without violating the BST property (keys(left) < key(root) <  keys(right)).

* Left Rotation
* Right Rotation

```
T1, T2 and T3 are subtrees of the tree rooted with y (on the left side) or x (on the right side)

     y                               x
    / \     Right Rotation          /  \
   x   T3   - - - - - - - >        T1   y 
  / \       < - - - - - - -            / \
 T1  T2     Left Rotation            T2  T3

Keys in both of the above trees follow the following order 
keys(T1) < key(x) < keys(T2) < key(y) < keys(T3)
So BST property is not violated anywhere.
```

**Steps to follow for insertion**
 Let the newly inserted node be w

* Perform standard BST insert for w.
*  Starting from w, travel up and find the first  unbalanced node.  Let z be the first unbalanced node, y be the child of z that comes on the path from w to z and x be the grandchild of z that  comes on the path from w to z.
* Re-balance the tree by performing appropriate  rotations on the sub-tree rooted with z. There can be 4 possible cases  that needs to be handled as x, y and z can be arranged in 4 ways.   Following are the possible 4 arrangements:
  * y is left child of z and x is left child of y (Left Left Case)
  *  y is left child of z and x is right child of y (Left Right Case)
  *  y is right child of z and x is right child of y (Right Right Case)
  *  y is right child of z and x is left child of y (Right Left Case)

It is quite difficult to understand whats written by the images makes it clear for our understanding. Following are the operations to be performed in above mentioned 4  cases. In all of the cases, we only need to re-balance the sub-tree  rooted with z and the complete tree becomes balanced as the height of  sub-tree (After appropriate rotations) rooted with z becomes same as it  was before insertion.

Image LR Rotation

Similar to above cases, we have RR rotation and RL rotation
