## Linked List and its variants

In this blog post, we'll learn everything about the linked list and its variants. We'll also implement different linked list in python.

Linked list consists of a set of nodes connected together in sequence, where each node has two placeholder, 

* First placeholder holds the element or data
* Second placeholder holds the address of the next node

The first node is called as **head** and the last node of the linked list is identified by having its second placeholder as **Null**.

In Heap, max-heap or min-heap, the insertion and deletion operation depends on number of nodes getting swapped and maintaining the heap property simultaneously. The time complexity varies from *1* to *Log n.* However, in Linked List, **the insertion and deletion operation takes constant time of 1.**

Linked List is a very important data structure as it helps in understanding other advance data structures like trees and graphs.

**Simple Linked List Implementation**

```python
class node:
    def __init__(self, item):
        self.data = item
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        
LL = LinkedList()
LL.head = node(1)
second_node = node(2)
third_node = node(3)

LL.head.next = second_node
second_node.next = third_node

between_node = node(2.5)
between_node.next = third_node
second_node.next = between_node

while LL.head != None:
    print(LL.head.data, end=" ")
    LL.head = LL.head.next
    
"""
1 2 2.5 3 
"""
```

**Applications**

* Hash Tables, Graphs and stack

**Operation in Linked List**

I've tried to implement the Insertion of all types, try out deletion.

* Insert a node at the beginning, at the middle or at the last.
* Delete a node at beginning, at the middle or at last.

### Insertion

**Insertion at the beginning**

* Create a ***new node*** and input the ***data*** to the node.
* Change the point of ***next*** of new node to the current ***head node***.
* Point the ***head*** to new node.

**Insertion at the middle**

* Create a ***new node*** and input the ***data*** to the node.
* Traverse to node before the ***required position*** where the new node is to be added
* Change ***next pointers*** to include new node in between

**Insertion at the End**

* Create a ***new node*** and input the ***data*** to the node.
* Traverse to the ***last node***
* Change ***next*** of last node to recently created ***new node***

### Deletion

**Deletion at the beginning**

* Change the Point head to the second node

**Deletion at the middle**

* Traverse to the element before the element to be deleted
* Change next pointers to exclude the node from the chain

**Deletion at the End**

- Traverse to second last element
- Change its next pointer to null

### Types of Linked List

* Singly Linked List
* Doubly Linked List
* Circular Linked List

**Singly Linked List** - Each node in this type of linked list has a data and a pointer to the next node, like the above case.

**Doubly Linked List** - Each node has a data and two pointer, one points to previous node and other points to next node. We can move in both directions.

**Circular Linked List** - The last node is connected to first node making it circular linked list. It can be both singly or doubly linked list but with connection between last and first node.

**Doubly Linked List Implementation**

```python
# Doubly Linked List

# Creating a Node 
class node:
    def __init__(self, item):
        self.data = item
        self.next = None
        self.prev = None

# Creating a Doubly Linked List
class DoublyLL:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        
    def push(self, element):
        new_node = node(element) # Creating a node with data, prev and next
        new_node.next = self.head # Making the new node as head node
        
        if self.head is not None: # Checking if current head point to null or not
            self.head.prev = new_node # if not null, then current node's prev will point to new node.
            
        self.head = new_node # New node is assigned as head node
        
    
    def insertAfter(self, prev_node, element):
        new_node = node(element) # Creating a node with data, prev and next
        
        if prev_node is None: # Checking if previous node after which we are inserting is NULL or not
            return "previous node cannot be NULL"
        
        new_node.next = prev_node.next #previous node's next element/node is pointed to new node's next
        prev_node.next = new_node #previous node points to new node
        new_node.prev = prev_node #previous node is pointed back by new_node
        
        if new_node.next is not None: 
            # Checking if new_node's next is not NULL, then new_node becomes the previous node of the next node of the new_node
            new_node.next.prev = new_node
            
    def append(self, element):
        new_node = node(element) # Creating a node with data, prev and next
        
        new_node.next = None #assigning the last node's next as None
        
        if self.head is None: #check if head node is NULL
            new_node.prev = None #Assigning previous points of new_node as NULL
            self.head = new_node #Assigning new_node as head of the linked list
            return
        
        last_node = self.head #assiging head node to variable name last_node!
        while last_node.next != None: #traversing through linked list, unless the next node is None
            last_node = last_node.next #keep moving to the next node of the linked list
            
        last_node.next = new_node #after reaching last node, new_node becomes next node of last node
        new_node.prev = last_node #and last node becomes previous node of the new_node
        
        return
    
    def printList(self, node):
 
        print("\nTraversal in forward direction")
        while(node is not None):
            print(node.data)
            last = node
            node = node.next
 
        print("\nTraversal in reverse direction")
        while(last is not None):
            print(last.data)
            last = last.prev

**Circular Linked List Implementation**

While implementing circular linked list, make sure keep track of the last node is connected with first node i.e head node.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, item):
        self.data = item
        self.next = None
        
class CircularLL:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        
    def push(self, element):
        new_node = Node(element)
        temp = self.head
         
        new_node.next = self.head
 
        # If linked list is not None then set the next of
        # last node
        if self.head is not None:
            while(temp.next != self.head):
                temp = temp.next
            temp.next = new_node
 
        else:
            new_node.next = new_node # For the first node
 
        self.head = new_node

    def append(self, element):
        new_node = Node(element)
        
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        else:
            last_node = self.head
            while last_node.next != self.head:
                last_node = last_node.next
                
        last_node.next = new_node
        new_node.next = self.head
        return
    
    def view(self):
        temp = self.head
        if self.head is not None:
            while(True):
                print(temp.data)
                temp = temp.next
                if (temp == self.head):
                    break

We covered linked list and its variants. We also implemented the same using Python. In the next blog post, we'll discuss about hash table and its related topic.
