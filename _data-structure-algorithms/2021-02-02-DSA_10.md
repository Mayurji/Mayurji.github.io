Consider a professional social networking site like Linkedin, where every time we connect with a different person, a link is formed between us and the other person. This small interaction is what is called as Graph Data Structure. Here, we and other person are the **vertex** in the graph and the connect request turns into an **edge** between you and the other person. Instead of other person, we can connect with other vertices like group page, attend an event (temporary node) etc. Thus, the whole of Linkedin is one big collection of vertices and edges.

Graph data structure is all about the vertices and its edges. a graph is a data structure (V, E)  consisting of 

* A collection of vertices V
* A collection of edges E, represent by pair of vertices (u, v).

### Graph - Jargon

Consider below set of vertices and edges, we have 4 vertices and 4 edges, the vertex 0 is directly connected with all vertices. And 1 is connected with 2, but there is no direct edge between (1, 3) and (2, 3)

```
V = {0, 1, 2, 3}
E = {(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,2)} 
G = {V, E}
```

**Adjacency**: A vertex is said to be adjacent to another vertex if there is an edge connecting them. 

* 0 and {1, 2, 3} are adjacent, while 3 and {1, 2} are not adjacent.

**Path**: A sequence of edges that allows you to go from vertex A to vertex B is called a path. 0-1, 1-2 and 0-2 are paths from vertex 0 to vertex 2.

**Directed Graph**: A graph in which an edge (u,v) doesn't necessarily mean that there is an edge (v, u) as well. The edges in such a graph are represented by arrows to show the direction of the edge. It similar to one-way street, where one can move from A to B but not B to A.

**Undirected Graph:** A graph in which the edges do not point in any direction (i.e. **the edges are bidirectional**).

**Connected Graph:** A graph in which there is always a path from a vertex to any other vertex. A path here refers to both direct path or an indirect path between the vertices.

### Graph Representation

* Adjacency Matrix: It is a 2D array of V x V vertices. Each row and column represent a vertex. If the value of any element `a[i][j]` is 1, it represents that there is an edge connecting vertex i and vertex j.

</center>

  Since it is an undirected graph, for edge (0,2), we also need to mark edge (2,0); making the adjacency matrix symmetric about the diagonal.

  Edge lookup(checking if an edge exists between vertex A and vertex B) is extremely fast in adjacency matrix representation but we have to  reserve space for every possible link between all vertices(V x V), so it requires more space.

* Adjacency List: It represents a graph as array of linked lists. The index of the array represents a vertex and each element in its linked list represents the other vertices that form an edge with the vertex.

  The adjacency list for the graph we made in the first example is as follows:

<p>Figure 3: Adjacency Lists - Programiz</p> 
</center>

  An adjacency list is efficient in terms of storage because we only  need to store the values for the edges. For a graph with millions of  vertices, this can mean a lot of saved space.

### Basic Operation in Graph

* Search 
* Graph Traversing
* Insertion
* Finding path from one vertex to other.

A widely used graph structure is **Spanning Tree** and its variant **Minimum Spanning Tree**.

**Spanning Tree:** It is a sub-graph of an undirected connected graph, **which includes all the vertices that are connected either directly or indirectly with least number of edges**. If a vertex is left alone then that sub-graph is not a spanning tree and the edges may or may not have weights assigned to them.

If a complete graph consists of **n** nodes, then **n^(n-2)** sub-graphs or spanning tree are possible.

If we have `n = 4`, the maximum number of possible spanning trees is equal to `4^(4-2)` `= 16`. Thus, 16 spanning trees can be formed from a complete graph with 4 vertices.

**Minimum Spanning Tree:** A minimum spanning tree is a tree in which the sum of the weight of the edges is as minimum as possible. MST is a weighted graph.

To find the minimum spanning tree in a graph, we can use two algorithms

* Prim's Algorithm
* Kruskal's Algorithm

### Adjacency Matrix and its implementation

Adjacency matrix A, is way of representing a graph G=(V, E) as a matrix of booleans.

**Matrix Representation:** VxV, V is the number of vertices and each entry in the matrix is represented by $$A_{ij}$$, its value is 1 or 0 depending on whether there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j.

In case of undirected graphs, the matrix is symmetric about the diagonal because of every edge `(i,j)`, there is also an edge `(j,i)`, undirected graphs are bidirectional.

**Why Adjacency Matrix?**

* Operations like adding an edge, removing an edge, checking if path from vertex i to vertex j exists or not are time efficient with constant time.
* Even if large number of vertices or edges are present, we can use adjacency matrix. Even for sparse adjacency matrix, we can use data structures relevant to it. 
* With GPUs, manipulating matrices is simple and faster.

**Drawbacks of Adjacency Matrix**

Matrix V x V is memory intensive and usually majority of the matrix is not fully connected, making Adjacency list preferred choice for most tasks. While basic operations are easy, operations like `inEdges` and `outEdges` are expensive when using the adjacency matrix representation.

**Implementation**

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.adjacency_matrix = []
        for i in range(size):
            self.adjacency_matrix.append([0 for i in range(size)])
        self.size = size
        
    def add_edge(self, v1, v2):
        if v1 == v2:
            print("Connecting to same vertex")
        self.adjacency_matrix[v1][v2] = 1
        self.adjacency_matrix[v2][v1] = 1
        
    def remove_edge(self, v1, v2):
        if self.adjacency_matrix[v1][v2] == 0:
            print("No edge between %d and %d" % (v1, v2))
            return
        self.adjacency_matrix[v1][v2] = 0
        self.adjacency_matrix[v2][v1] = 0
    
    def __len__(self):
        return self.size
    
    def print_matrix(self):
        for row in self.adjacency_matrix:
            print(row)
 """

g.add_edge(0, 1)
g.add_edge(0, 2)

 """
```

### Adjacency List and its implementation

It represent graph data structure using a array of linked lists. Each index in the array represents the vertex and each element in the linked list represents the other vertices that form an edge with the vertex.

The simplest adjacency list needs a node data structure to store a vertex and a graph data structure to organize the nodes. We stay close to the basic definition of a graph - a collection of vertices and edges `{V, E}`. For simplicity, we use an unlabeled graph as opposed to a labeled one  i.e. the vertices are identified by their indices 0,1,2,3.

**Implementation**

```python
# Adjascency List representation in Python


class AdjNode:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.vertex = value 
        self.next = None


class Graph:
    def __init__(self, num):
        self.V = num
        self.graph = [None] * self.V 
        # Declare Array of size as Number of vertices, each index in array is a vertex & each element is a linked list

    # Add edges
    def add_edge(self, s, d):
        node = AdjNode(d) 
        node.next = self.graph[s]
        self.graph[s] = node

        node = AdjNode(s)
        node.next = self.graph[d]
        self.graph[d] = node

    # Print the graph
    def print_agraph(self):
        for i in range(self.V):
            print("Vertex " + str(i) + ":", end="")
            temp = self.graph[i]
            while temp:
                print(" -> {}".format(temp.vertex), end="")
                temp = temp.next
            print(" \n")

"""
V = 5

# Create graph and edges
graph = Graph(V)
graph.add_edge(0, 1)
graph.add_edge(0, 2)
graph.add_edge(0, 3)
graph.add_edge(1, 2)

graph.print_agraph()

Vertex 1: -> 2 -> 0

```

**Application**

* Interesting application of Minimum spanning tree, In maps, we can reach from A to B with least distance travel consider there are multiple paths available.
* Spanning tree application includes Cluster Analysis, Civil Network planning etc.
* Minimum spanning tree applications includes design networks like telecommunication networks, water supply networks etc.
