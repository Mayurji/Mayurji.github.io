In this blog post, we'll learn about algorithms used on graph or tree data structure. Both the algorithms DFS and BFS are used for searching through the vertices of a tree or graph data structure as efficiently as possible.

### Depth First Search or Depth First Traversal

It is a recursive algorithm, searching all the vertices in the graph or tree. It puts each vertex into two categories either **visited** or **not visited**. The purpose of the algorithm is to mark each vertex while avoiding cycles. DFS follows pre-order traversal, first visits the root, then left subtree and then right subtree. We keep track of non-visited node in stack.

DFS algorithm works as follows:

1. Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices on top of a **stack**.
2. Take the top item of the stack and add it to the visited list.
3. Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to the top of the stack.
4. Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty.

**Implementation**

```python
# DFS algorithm
def dfs(graph, start, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set() # A set to keep track of visited nodes
    visited.add(start) # Adding visited vertices

    print(start)

    for next in graph[start] - visited: # Remove visited vertex from list or graph.
        dfs(graph, next, visited) # Recursively, visit other nodes while keep track of visited vertices.
    return visited

"""
graph = {'0': set(['1', '2']),
         '1': set(['0', '3', '4']),
         '2': set(['0']),
         '3': set(['1']),
         '4': set(['2', '3'])}

dfs(graph, '0')

0
1
3
4
2
2

{'0', '1', '2', '3', '4'}
"""
```

**Time Complexity - DFS**

Time complexity for a DFS algorithm is O(V + E), V is the number of the vertices and E is the number of edges.

### Breadth First Search or Breadth First Traversal

Similar to DFS, Breadth first search is used for traversing through all the vertices of the graph. Only difference between is how the traversing is done. **In DFS, once we find a new node, we explore it first. But in BFS, each node is explored completely before moving to new node.**

BFS follows **level order**, it moves from one level to another level. And BFS uses **queue** for keeping track of not-visited node.

The purpose of the algorithm is to mark each vertex as visited while avoiding cycles.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices at the back of a queue.
2. Take the front item of the queue and add it to the visited list.
3. Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to the back of the queue.
4. Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the queue is empty.

**Implementation**

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class graph:    
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = defaultdict(list)
        
	def add_edge(self, u, v):
        self.graph[u] = v
        
    def bfs(self, s):
        visited = [False] * (len(self.graph))
        queue = []
        queue.append(s)
        visited[s]= True
        
        while queue:
            s = queue.pop(0)
            print(s, end=" ")
            for i in self.graph[s]:
                if visited[i] == False:
                    queue.append(i)
                    visited[i] = True
"""
g = Graph()
g.addEdge(0, 1)
g.addEdge(0, 2)
g.addEdge(1, 2)
g.addEdge(2, 0)
g.addEdge(2, 3)
g.addEdge(3, 3)

print("BFS starts at 2: ")
g.bfs(2)

BFS starts at 2: 
2 0 3 1 
"""
```

We've used adjacency list to represent the graph.

**Time Complexity - BFS**

The Time complexity of BFS is O(V + E) when Adjacency List is used and O(V^2) when Adjacency Matrix is used.

**Application**

***DFS***

* Finding path in graph
* Finding cycles in graph

***BFS***

* Building Search index
* GPS Navigation
* Minimum Spanning Tree
* Finding Path and cycles
