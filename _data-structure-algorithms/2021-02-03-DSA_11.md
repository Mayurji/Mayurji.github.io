In this blog post, we'll learn about algorithms based on **Graph and Tree** data structure. Both the DFS and BFS are used for searching through the vertices/nodes of the tree and graph data structure as efficiently as possible and it also helps in identifying if a cycle is present in the data structure.

### Depth First Search or Depth First Traversal

**DFS** is a recursive algorithm and it traverses through all the vertices in the graph or tree data structure. It keeps each vertex in two categories either **visited** or **not visited**. The purpose of the algorithm is to mark each vertex while avoiding cycles. DFS follows **pre-order traversal**, it first visits the root, then the left subtree, and then the right subtree. In DFS, we keep track of non-visited nodes in the stack data structure.

**Steps in Depth First Search**

1. Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices on top of a **stack**.
2. Take the top item of the stack and add it to the visited list.
3. Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to the top of the stack.
4. Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty.

**Implementation**

```python

        # DFS algorithm
        def dfs(graph, start, visited=None):
            if visited is None:
                visited = set() # A set to keep track of visited nodes
            visited.add(start) # Adding visited vertices

            print(start)

            for next in graph[start] - visited: # Remove visited vertex from list or graph.
                dfs(graph, next, visited) # Recursively, visit other nodes while keeping track of visited vertices.
            return visited
        """
        graph = {'0': set(['1', '2']),
                '1': set(['0', '3', '4']),
                '2': set(['0']),
                '3': set(['1']),
                '4': set(['2', '3'])}

        dfs(graph, '0')

        0
        1
        3
        4
        2
        2

        {'0', '1', '2', '3', '4'}
        """

```
**Time Complexity - DFS**

The time complexity for the DFS algorithm is **O(V + E)**, V is the number of the vertices and E is the number of edges.

### Breadth-First Search or Breadth First Traversal

Similar to DFS, Breadth-first search is used for traversing through all the vertices of the graph. The only difference between them is how the traversing takes place. **In DFS, once we find a new node, we explore it first. But in BFS, each node is explored completely before moving to the new node.**

BFS follows **level order** traversal, it moves from one level to another level. And BFS uses **queue** for keeping track of not-visited nodes. BFS marks each vertex as visited while identifying the cycles in the Graph.

**Steps in Breadth-First Search**

1. Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices at the back of a queue.
2. Take the front item of the queue and add it to the visited list.
3. Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to the back of the queue.
4. Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the queue is empty.

**Implementation**

```python

        from collections import defaultdict

        class graph:    
            def __init__(self):
                self.graph = defaultdict(list)
                
            def addEdge(self, u, v):
                self.graph[u].append(v)
                
            def bfs(self, s):
                visited = [False] * (len(self.graph))
                queue = []
                queue.append(s)
                visited[s]= True
                
                while queue:
                    s = queue.pop(0)
                    print(s, end=" ")
                    for i in self.graph[s]:
                        if visited[i] == False:
                            queue.append(i)
                            visited[i] = True
        """
        g = graph()
        g.addEdge(0, 1)
        g.addEdge(0, 2)
        g.addEdge(1, 2)
        g.addEdge(2, 0)
        g.addEdge(2, 3)
        g.addEdge(3, 3)

        print("BFS starts at 2: ")
        g.bfs(2)

        BFS starts at 2: 
        2 0 3 1 
        """

```
We've used an adjacency list to represent the graph.

**Time Complexity - BFS**

The Time complexity of BFS is **O(V + E)** when **adjacency list** is used and **O(V^2)** when adjacency matrix is used.

**Application**

**DFS**

* Finding path in the graph.
* Finding cycles in the graph.

**BFS**

* Building Search index
* GPS Navigation
* Minimum Spanning Tree
* Finding Path and cycles
