In this blog post, we'll discuss hash tables and hash functions. First time, I've come across hash tables while I was reading about **dict** and **set** objects in Python. Under the hood, the **dict** and **set** uses a hash table for assigning a key to a value/data. Hash tables help dict and set to have a lookup and insertion at O(1). It achieves this efficient mapping of key to value using a **hashing function**.

Let's deep dive into hash tables and things related to it.

### What is a Hash Table?

Hash table is a data structure which presents data in the form of **key-value** pair. Key is used as an index to access the value or data. Each data is associated with a key and each key is an integer.

In similar context to hash table is **Direct Address Table** (DAT), when we have a small set of numbers to look up we can use a direct address table, here we cannot have two values pointed by the same key. It similar to **List** data structure, where we have a unique index for each element. A major limitation in such a table is the space occupied by the number of keys and with a large number of keys, we'll have a large value as index.

In **hash table**, the keys are processed to get a new index, which is then mapped to the value or data. This process is called as **Hashing**. The function which process the key to get new index is called as **Hashing function**.

A particular issue faced by hash tables is, If the same index is generated by a hashing function for multiple keys then, conflict arises. This situation is called as **Collision**. We can avoid or reduce the number of collisions by identifying a good hash function. But it is impossible to avoid collisions completely.

**Why Hash table over DAT?**

We've seen the space issue with DAT as the number of keys or indices increase and we can reduce the space occupied by these indices by using hash function. For example: If `k = 9845648451321`, then `h(k) = 11` (by using some hash function). This helps in saving the memory wasted while providing the index of `9845648451321` to the array.

**Creating Hash Table**

Similar to creating an array, we should block a chunk of memory to create a hash table. Since we are creating an index based on the key using hash function, we must ensure that the index generated fits within the chunk the memory or buckets. 

> *Placing new data in a hash table requires two checks: the hashed value of the key and how the value compares to other objects. This is because when we insert data, the key is first hashed and masked so that it turns into an effective index in an array. The mask makes sure that the hash value, which can take the value of any integer, fits within the allocated number of buckets. So if we have allocated 8 blocks of memory, each block is 1 byte and our hash value is `28975`, we consider the bucket at index `28975 & 0b111 = 7`. If, however, our hash table has grown to require 512 blocks of memory, the mask becomes `0b111111111` (and in this case, we would consider the bucket at index `28975 & 0b11111111`). Mask helps in constraining the index to be pulled into the bucket.* 

Checkout this [convert binary to decimal](https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/math/binary-calculator.html) to understand how the index is formed by hash value and mask, In the url, keep 28975 as decimal & operation and then 7 decimal and calculate binary! 

 Now, once we find an index, we check if the index is empty or not? 

* If empty, then we move the key and value into the block.
* If not empty, Case 1: then hash uses the inbuilt **\__cmp__** function to check the value at the index and value we are inserting is the same then we return.
* If not empty, Case 2: if the values residing are different from the one we are inserting, then we are under collision.

### Basic Methods to write Hash Function

**Division Method**

If size of the hash table is m and k is the key whose indices is to be found then we calculate the hash function as follows:
<p>
$$
h(k)\ =\ k\ mod\ m
$$
</p>
 
If hash table size is 10 and k=111 then h(k) = 111 mod 10 = 1,The size of table should not be in powers of 2, because the binary form of 2, 4, 8... leads to 10, 100.. so on.

**Multiplication Method**

To find the indices for the keys, we follow the below hash function

<p>
$$
h(k)\ =\ ⌊m(kA\ mod\ 1)⌋

\\ where,\ 0 <\ A <\ 1\ and

\\ (kA\ mod\ 1)\ gives\ the fractional\ part\ kA.

\\ ⌊\ ⌋\ gives\ the\ floor\ value
$$
</p>

**Universal Hashing**

In Universal hashing, the hash function is chosen at random independent of keys.

**Hash Collision Sample**

```python

        class City(str):
            def __hash__(self):
                return ord(self[0])

        # We create a dictionary where we assign arbitrary values to cities
        data =  {
            City("Rome"): 'Italy',
            City("San Francisco"): 'USA',
            City("New York"): 'USA',
            City("Barcelona"): 'Spain',
        }

        """
        hash("Barcelona") = ord("B") & 0b111
                        = 66 & 0b111
                        = 0b1000010 & 0b111
                        = 0b010 = 2

        hash("Rome") = ord("R") & 0b111
                    = 82 & 0b111
                    = 0b1010010 & 0b111
                    = 0b010 = 2
        """

```

**How to act under Collision**

To avoid collision, we should find a new index for the value to store. A technique **open addressing** is used for resolving the collision. Some methods in open addressing are 

* Linear probing
* Quadratic probing
* Double Hashing

#### Linear Probing

We resolve collisions using linear probing by checking if the next slot is available. It is a naive way to resolve collisions. Consider if clusters of adjacent slots are filled then linear probing traverses through the whole cluster before moving to a new cluster where the slot is available. **h(k, i) is the hash function.**
<p>
$$
h(k, i) = (h'(k) + i)\ mod\ m 
\\
m - size\ of\ hash\ table 
\\
i - \{0, 1,...\}
$$
</p>
If a collision occurs at `h(k, 0)`, then `h(k, 1)` is checked. In this way, the value of `i` is incremented linearly.

#### Quadratic Probing

As the name suggest, we increase the spacing between the slot by more than one using the following relation
<p>
$$
h(k,\ i)\ = (h'(k)\ +\ c_1i\ +\ c_2i^2)\ mod\ m
\\
c_1,\ c_2\ are\ positive\ constant.
\\
i - \{0, 1,...\}
$$
</p>

#### Double Hashing

If a collision occurs after applying a hash function `h(k)`, then another hash function is calculated for finding the next slot.
<p>
$$
h(k, i)\ = (h_1(k) +\ ih_2(k))\ mod\ m
$$
</p>

**Remember while creating Hash Function**

* Indices generated should be small unlike DAT, such that it fits in buckets
* The indices generated should not be very close or very far in range.
* The collision should be minimized as much as possible.

We have seen the basics of hash tables and its related topics. It has applications in cryptography, cryptocurrency and implementation of databases etc. We'll check out tree data structure in the next blog, a very important concept in data structure and algorithms.
